# git-stalk
Love stalking GitHub Profile. Then try this out!!

--------------------------------------------
## How to Start the Project
- ``` npm i```
-  Create a .env in the root folder and Set Environment Variable: ```REACT_APP_OAUTH_TOKEN = Your GitHub OAUTH Token```
- ``` npm start```
- ***Note:*** You can still run the project without setting the environment varibale. It's just to increase [Rate Limit](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting)

## To Create Optimized Build
```npm run build```

## To run tests
```npm run test```

## Why I made this?
Because I wanted to explore GitHub API and have fun with it. And also I was inspired by this awesome [telegram bot](https://github.com/aashutoshrathi/git-profiler-bot) made by [Aashutosh Rathi](https://github.com/aashutoshrathi) for which he has to pay monthly bill of 1 INR because of me. 

## Thanks
