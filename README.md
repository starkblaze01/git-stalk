## Why I made this?
Because I wanted to explore GitHub API and have fun with it. And also I was inspired by this awesome [telegram bot](https://github.com/aashutoshrathi/git-profiler-bot) made by [Aashutosh Rathi](https://github.com/aashutoshrathi) for which he had to pay monthly bill of 1 INR because of meðŸ˜“.
